	<p>A Celebration of Sri Lankan Traditions<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
	From the ancient dynasties of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa to the colonial era of the Portuguese, Dutch and British, 
	our beautiful island of Sri Lanka has a long and rich history. Dubbed as the home of pure Ceylon tea, each era of Sri 
	Lanka’s past has shaped the country uniquely and irrevocably and has given rise to several religious, cultural and social 
	traditions.One such famous tradition is the Esala Perahera. Also known as the Kandy Perahera or Dalada Perahera, this 
	ten-day-long festival commemorates the first teaching given by the Buddha after he attained enlightenment. Held between 
	July and August in the mist-laden city of Kandy. With drummers, dancers, musicians and elephants carrying precious objects like
	the sacred tooth relic, the perahera is a sensory experience.
	Another important tradition that has gradually been intertwined with the country’s culture, is the tradition of growing and 
	making tea. In 1824, Scotsman James Taylor planted the first 19 acres of tea in Loolecondera Estate near Kandy, Ceylon. Since 
	then, tea has become a thriving industry and is a part of everyday Sri Lankan life. 
	Zesta’s Perahera Elephant is the perfect amalgamation of these two beloved Sri Lankan traditions. This novelty tea gift contains
	Zesta premium black tea presented in a rich wooden box and a porcelain tusker donning its traditional perahera costume. Much like 
	the perahera, the tradition of growing, preparing and enjoying tea, whether it be English Breakfast tea, Earl Grey black tea or even 
	green tea, is a sensory experience. </span></p>
